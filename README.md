# BadWeatherFinder
The project idea is to predict bad weather conditions between two travel points.
Normally, we easily select the route between two places without taking the weather into consideration. 
However, the weather is an important feature for travelling and transporting.
For business purposes like transportation, delivery or for day to day purpose like walking, driving this project will help them by identifying the bad weather conditions like raining, snowing and windy. This project takes time into account and predicts the weather based on the travel time and the corresponding weather forecast at that moment.
